Optimal sensor placement for the spatial reconstruction of sound fields. 
EURASIP Journal on Audio, Speech and Music Processing (2024).

The results of this publication can be reproduced by running the files 
'experiment1.m', 'experiment2.m', 'experiment3.m', 'experiment4.m' and 
'experiment5.m'. To run 'experiment5.m' one first needs to download the 
dataset: "Hahmann, M., Verburg, S.A., Fernandez-Grande, E.: Acoustic 
frequency responses of an empty cuboid room. Technical University of 
Denmark (2021) https://doi.org/10.11583/DTU.13315289.v1" and place the file 
"empty_cuboid_room_frequency_responses.h5" inside the folder ./data
